# Walter-White-Resume :alembic: :minibus:

This project was made during my first month at Wild Code School with three other classmates. The goal was to create a resume for a character using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
I worked mainly on the homepage, contact page, dark mode, navigation bars (mobile and desktop) and footer.
